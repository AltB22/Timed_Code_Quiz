# Project: Timed Code Quiz

## Project Description: Create a timed quiz testing coding aptitude

- The goal of this project was to create a timed quiz application that allows a user to test their knowlede of JavaScript and save their score to locals storage score using their initials as key to pulling the score value.  20 points are added for each correctly answered question and 10 seconds is deducted from remaining time for each incorrect answer.

- The app runs in the browser and features JavaScript and dynamically updated HTML content and CSS styling.

- After completing the quiz and entering initials, the user can see the saved list of user initials/scores.  A home button at the end will refresh the quiz.

## User Story

- AS A coding boot camp student
- I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
- SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score
